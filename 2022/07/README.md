## Puzzle 1

The file `input.txt` contains a terminal output and each line represents either a command or an output of the contents in a directory.

The assignment is to rebuild the filesystem based on that output. Then find all of the directories with a total size of at most X and sum them together.

## Puzzle 2

The filesystem has a total disk space of X and we need Y of free disk space. Currently Z of disk space is already used.

The assignment is to find the smallest possible directory that would free up enough space.

## Puzzle 1

The file `input.txt` contains a single string (a very long one).

The assignment is to find the first occurrence of a 4 character long substring where all the characters within the substring are unique compared to each other. The output will be the number of characters from the beginning of the string until the last character in the found substring.

## Puzzle 2

Exactly the same a puzzle 1 but instead of 4, the substring should be 14 characters long.
